Global Game Jam '16
Version 1.0
*******************************

TO COMPILE AND RUN FROM SOURCE ON UBUNTU:

cd [PROJECT_DIR]
sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-dev libsdl2-mixer-dev cmake -y
cmake .
make
./[BINARY_NAME]


The project should be buildable on Windows and Mac with CMake and the SDL2 development libraries installed. CLion was used to develop the game, but is not required.
